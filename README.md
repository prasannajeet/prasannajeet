### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Toronto ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ based Mobile developer with 10+ years of industry experience with a passion for developing modern mobile applications and libraries using Android, React Native, KMM with MVI and Clean Architecture practicese. I am a self-taught, self-motivated mobile developer working in this field since the wild, wild west days when it was cool to write all the application code in one Activity, living through Fragments, MVP, MVVM, MVI etc.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about
1. Should you use KMM, RN, Flutter or native for your next app
2. Clean Architecture using MVI (using hooks in RN, using StateFlows in Android/KMM)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
1. Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile
2. React Native
